### Running locally
1. Execute the scripts in both `assets/` and `data/` to fetch required resources
1. Start a HTTP server at the root of this repo (`python3 -m http.server`)

### Would have been impossible without:
- The maintainer(s) of [dbd.tricky.lol](https://dbd.tricky.lol/help/) for hosting a well-documented and reliable DBD web API
- The contributors of [deadbydaylight.fandom.com](https://deadbydaylight.fandom.com) for keeping the wiki up-to-date and correct
    - Special thanks to **Jouki** for their contributions towards creating spritesheets of Characters and Perks
